# Memory-Game

This project is inspired from a memory game for children with 6+ years of age. In order to begin with this game on this website, player has to press "A" on their keyboard and the game begins with a pattern flashing on their screen with a different sound effect of each colored tile. If the player guessed the pattern right, the level increases, new pattern flashes on the screen and if the player presses a wrong button, then the screen displays *GAME OVER* flashes red background and player can restart from LEVEL 1 by pressing any key on their keyboard.
